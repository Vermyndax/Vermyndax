### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Yay I found a secret. I'll take what I can get any day.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Flexera as a DevOps/SRE Team Lead.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Swift and everything else I can possibly soak up.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that helps me avoid meetings.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with mental health.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything... if I don't know, I'll find out.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: text me.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Somehow I am a second degree black belt in TKD. No, I didn't buy it.
